# Multiblock Machine Guide

## 1. Formation
- All machines must be built as a **3x3x3 Hollow Cube**.
- The **Machine Controller** (Furnace or Assembler) must be placed in the **Front Center** (middle row, middle column, front face).
- The rest of the shell must be made of **Machine Casings**.
- If built correctly, you will hear a **Ding** sound when the controller checks the structure (every 2 seconds).

## 2. Powering
- Place the machine on an **Electrical Floor**.
- Ensure the floor network has power (e.g., connect a **Creative Energy Source** to any part of the floor).
- Machines pull power from the floor block directly beneath the controller.

## 3. Usage
- **Right-Click** the controller to open the GUI.
- If the structure is incomplete, it will tell you in chat.
- **Electric Furnace:**
  - Standard smelting logic.
  - Consumes 100 FE/t.
- **Auto Assembler:**
  - Prototype logic: Currently duplicates the input item.
  - Consumes 500 FE/t.

## 4. UI Details
- The GUI displays the current **FE level** of the connected floor network in the top left.
- Standard input (left) and output (right) slots.
- Shift-clicking is not yet optimized, use manual drag for now.
